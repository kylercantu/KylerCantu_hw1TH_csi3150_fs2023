      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello current reader(s), my name is Kyler and I'm from Troy, Michigan!
        I'm currently attending Oakland University and pursuing a Bachelor's
        degree in Computer Science. Prior to majoring in Computer Science, I
        spent about two and a half years pursuing an entirely different degree,
        which was Criminal Justice. I come from a Law Enforcement family and
        always thought that's what I wanted to do in the future, but at the same
        time I was always the kid who loved playing with technology/electronics.
        I've always heard about coding/programming growing up but never thought
        that I could do it since I had zero experience and never wrote a single
        line of code once in my life. Fast forward to my college years, while
        still pursuing my Criminal Justice Degree, I decided to attend an Intro
        to Coding Workshop at Grand Circus in Detroit which was a one-day two
        hour session where they taught the very basics of the java programming
        language. Ever since I wrote that first line of code, I knew that this
        is what I wanted to do!
      </p>
      <p>
        My short term goal while I'm still a student is to get internships so
        that I can gain knowledge and understand how the industry works in the
        real world. As of righth now, for my long term goal in this profession,
        I would like to hopefully become a back-end engineer! To know more about
        me, click on my Resume page and/or my Fun Facts page!
