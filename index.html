        <p class="aboutMe">
          Hello current reader(s), my name is Kyler and I'm from Troy, Michigan!
          I'm currently attending Oakland University and pursuing a Bachelor's
          degree in Computer Science. Prior to majoring in Computer Science, I
          spent about two and a half years pursuing an entirely different
          degree, which was Criminal Justice. I come from a Law Enforcement
          family and always thought that's what I wanted to do in the future,
          but at the same time I was always the kid who loved playing with
          technology/electronics. I've always heard about coding/programming
          growing up but never thought that I could do it since I had zero
          experience and never wrote a single line of code once in my life. Fast
          forward to my college years, while still pursuing my Criminal Justice
          Degree, I decided to attend an Intro to Coding Workshop at Grand
          Circus in Detroit which was a one-day two hour session where they
          taught the very basics of the java programming language. Ever since I
          wrote that first line of code, I knew that this is what I wanted to
          do!
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe">
          My short term goal while I'm still a student is to get internships so
          that I can gain knowledge and understand how the industry works in the
          real world. For my long term goal in this profession, as of right now,
          I would like to hopefully become a back-end engineer! To know more
          about me, click on my
